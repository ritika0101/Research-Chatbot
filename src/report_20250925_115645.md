## Contradictions

There are no explicit contradictions within the provided data.  However, the claim of a $100,000 fee increase [https://indianexpress.com/article/world/h1b-visa-2025-fees-validity-period-new-rules-latest-policy-and-changes-you-must-know-10268564/]  requires further clarification as it's described as a "one-time" fee in one source [https://indianexpress.com/article/world/h1b-visa-2025-fees-validity-period-new-rules-latest-policy-and-changes-you-must-know-10268564/], while the Wikipedia article [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa] details a more complex history of fee changes and program modifications without mentioning this specific $100,000 fee.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile these details.  The extensive history of legislative and executive actions affecting the H-1B visa program [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa] also lacks specific mention of the described fee increase in the Indian Express article.


## Conclusion

The H-1B visa program is subject to frequent changes and interpretations.  Further research is recommended to fully understand the current regulations and their impact.
