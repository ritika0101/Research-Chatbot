# H-1B Visa Program Report
## Overview
The H-1B visa program is a non-immigrant visa program that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations. The program has been subject to controversy and proposed changes, including a new $100,000 fee for certain H-1B visa petitions.

## Findings

### Presidential Proclamation
On September 19, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation titled "Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers," which aims to reform the H-1B visa program and curb abuses [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/).

### H-1B Visa Program Statistics

### New Fee for H-1B Visa Petitions
On September 21, 2025, a new $100,000 fee for certain H-1B visa petitions went into effect [https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/h-1b-faq](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/h-1b-faq). This fee applies to petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025.

### H-1B Cap Season
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has reached the congressionally mandated cap of 65,000 H-1B visas for fiscal year 2026 [https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season).

## Contradictions
After analyzing the findings, some contradictions were identified:

* The effective date of the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa petitions is reported as September 19, 2025 [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/), while another source reports it as September 21, 2025 [https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/h-1b-faq](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/h-1b-faq).
* The H-1B visa program is both praised and criticized by different sources. Some sources highlight the importance of the program in filling critical labor needs [https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/h1b-visa-program-fact-sheet/](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/h1b-visa-program-fact-sheet/), while others argue that it has been abused and needs to be reformed [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/).

## Conclusion
The H-1B visa program is a complex and contentious issue, with different stakeholders holding varying opinions on its benefits and drawbacks. The new $100,000 fee for certain H-1B visa petitions is a significant change that will impact employers and foreign workers. Further analysis and evaluation of the program's effects are necessary to determine its overall impact on the U.S. economy and labor market.
