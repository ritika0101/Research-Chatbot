## ClearTax History of GST [https://cleartax.in/s/history-of-gst](https://cleartax.in/s/history-of-gst)

ClearTax provides a history of GST in India, mentioning its implementation in 2017 and the role of Arun Jaitley [https://cleartax.in/s/history-of-gst](https://cleartax.in/s/history-of-gst).  The article also notes the global history of GST, dating back to 1954 [https://cleartax.in/s/history-of-gst](https://cleartax.in/s/history-of-gst).  A contradiction arises from the claim that GST was introduced in India in 2017, while other sources indicate a 2025 implementation of *new* reforms.
