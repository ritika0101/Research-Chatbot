# H-1B Visa Program and Related Trends

## Findings

### H-1B Cap for Fiscal Year 2025

The USCIS has reached the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption, known as the master’s cap, for fiscal year (FY) 2025 [https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-reaches-fiscal-year-2025-h-1b-cap](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-reaches-fiscal-year-2025-h-1b-cap).

### Non-Selection Notices

USCIS will send non-selection notices to registrants through their online accounts. The status for properly submitted registrations that were not selected will show "Not Selected: Not selected – not eligible to file an H-1B cap petition based on this registration" [https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-reaches-fiscal-year-2025-h-1b-cap](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-reaches-fiscal-year-2025-h-1b-cap).

### Exempt Petitions

USCIS will continue to accept and process petitions that are otherwise exempt from the cap. Petitions filed for current H-1B workers who have been counted previously against the cap and still retain their cap number are exempt from the FY2025 H-1B cap [https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-reaches-fiscal-year-2025-h-1b-cap](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-reaches-fiscal-year-2025-h-1b-cap).

### H-1B Visa Program Overview

The H-1B visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions [30].

Foreign workers fill a critical need in the U.S. labor market, particularly in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields [https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/h1b-visa-program-fact-sheet/](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/h1b-visa-program-fact-sheet/).

### Proposed Changes

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed significant changes to how H-1B visa registrations are selected in the annual cap lottery, favoring higher-wage positions [https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/09/dhs-proposes-new-h1b-rule-that-prioritizes-higher-paid-workers](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/09/dhs-proposes-new-h1b-rule-that-prioritizes-higher-paid-workers).

The Department of Labor requires that the wages offered to a foreign worker must be the prevailing wage rate for the occupational classification in the area of employment [https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/wages](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/wages).

### New Proclamation

A new proclamation adds restrictions to the H-1B visa program, including a $100,000 fee per worker for certain H-1B petitions filed for employees outside the United States. The proclamation also directs government agencies to make broader changes to the H-1B system, including raising prevailing wage levels and prioritizing higher-paid, highly skilled foreign workers [https://www.grossmanyoung.com/blog/new-proclamation-h1b/](https://www.grossmanyoung.com/blog/new-proclamation-h1b/).

## Contradictions

Contradictions were found in the data, particularly regarding projected growth rates and specific statistics related to H-1B visas and technology trends. For example, different sources provided varying projections for IT spending growth in 2025, and some reports had conflicting information on the number of H-1
