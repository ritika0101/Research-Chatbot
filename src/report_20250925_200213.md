# Explainable AI (XAI) Report
## Overview

Explainable AI (XAI) refers to a set of processes and methods that allow human users to comprehend and trust the results and output created by machine learning algorithms. The main goal of XAI is to make AI systems transparent by showing how they reach decisions, allowing humans to understand, trust, and regulate their outputs.

## Definition and Purpose

XAI is used to describe an AI model, its expected impact, and potential biases. It helps characterize model accuracy, fairness, transparency, and outcomes in AI-powered decision making. The purpose of XAI is to improve and debug AI models, look to meet regulatory requirements, and have more trust in AI models' decisions and predictions.

## Key Concepts

* **Transparency**: The processes that extract model parameters from training data and generate labels from testing data can be described and motivated by the approach designer.
* **Interpretability**: The possibility of comprehending the ML model and presenting the underlying basis for decision-making in a way that is understandable to humans.
* **Explainability**: The collection of features of the interpretable domain that have contributed, for a given example, to producing a decision.

## Benefits

* **Better decision-making**: Understanding how to influence predicted outcomes.
* **Improved trust**: By providing insights into the decision-making process of AI models.
* **Regulatory compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.

## Techniques and Methods

* **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: A technique for explaining the output of a machine learning model.
* **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**: A technique for explaining the output of a machine learning model.
* **Tree surrogates**: A method for explaining complex models by approximating them with simpler models.

## Challenges and Limitations

* **Trade-off between model complexity and interpretability**: Highly complex models often offer superior predictive performance but are notoriously difficult to interpret.
* **Context-dependent explanations**: Explanations can change over time and are situationally dependent.

## Contradictions

Contradictions were found in the sources regarding the definition and application of XAI. Some sources emphasize the importance of transparency, while others focus on interpretability and explainability. [https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) provide different perspectives on the definition and purpose of XAI.

## Conclusion

Explainable AI (XAI) is a crucial aspect of artificial intelligence that aims to make AI systems transparent and trustworthy. By providing insights into the decision-making process of AI models, XAI enables humans to understand, trust, and regulate their outputs. While there are challenges and limitations to implementing XAI, its benefits make it an essential component of AI development.
