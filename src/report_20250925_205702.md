# H-1B Visa Program: Restrictions and Updates
The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform high-skilled functions. However, the program has been exploited to replace American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.

## Key Findings

* The H-1B visa program has been abused by some employers to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].
* The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].
* Among computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7% in 2000 to 26.1% in 2019 [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].

## Presidential Proclamation
On September 19, 2025, President Trump issued a Proclamation entitled “Restrictions on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers” that imposes a $100,000 fee for most new H-1B visa petitions and restricts the ability of certain H-1B visa holders to enter the United States [https://www.employmentlawworldview.com/understanding-the-new-100000-h-1b-fee-and-its-effect-on-u-s-employers/].

## Contradictions
There are contradictions in the reporting of the Presidential Proclamation's effective date and the fee structure. Some sources indicate that the fee applies to petitions submitted after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025 [https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/h-1b-faq], while others mention that the Proclamation's plain language appeared to bar any H-1B visa holder from entering the United States without having paid a new $100,000 fee [https://www.employmentlawworldview.com/understanding-the-new-100000-h-1b-fee-and-its-effect-on-u-s-employers/].

## H-1B Cap Season
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced that it has received enough petitions to reach the congressionally mandated 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and the 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption for fiscal year 2026 [https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season].

## Conclusion
The H-1B visa program is undergoing significant changes, including the implementation of a $100,000 fee for new petitions and restrictions on entry for certain visa holders. However, there are contradictions in the reporting of these changes, and the USCIS has announced that it has reached the congressionally mandated cap for fiscal year 2026.
