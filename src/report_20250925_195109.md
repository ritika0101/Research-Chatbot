# Explainable AI (XAI) Report

## Introduction

Explainable AI (XAI) refers to a set of processes and methods that allow human users to comprehend and trust the results and output created by machine learning algorithms. The goal of XAI is to make AI models more transparent, accountable, and trustworthy.

## Findings

* XAI is used to describe an AI model, its expected impact, and potential biases [https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai).
* XAI helps characterize model accuracy, fairness, transparency, and outcomes in AI-powered decision making [https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai).
* There are three main types of XAI methods: intrinsically interpretable models, post-hoc explanation techniques, and visualization-based approaches [https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/what-are-the-types-of-explainable-ai-methods](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/what-are-the-types-of-explainable-ai-methods).
* XAI has various applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles [https://smythos.com/developers/agent-development/explainable-ai-examples/](https://smythos.com/developers/agent-development/explainable-ai-examples/).

## Contradictions

Upon analyzing the findings, some contradictions were identified:

* The use of XAI can be contested, and explanations can be situationally dependent and change over time [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X21001027](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X21001027).
* There is a trade-off between model complexity and interpretability, with highly complex models often being difficult to interpret [https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/what-are-the-limitations-of-explainable-ai](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/what-are-the-limitations-of-explainable-ai).

## Conclusion

Explainable AI (XAI) is a crucial aspect of artificial intelligence that enables human users to understand and trust AI models. While XAI has various applications and benefits, it also has limitations and contradictions. By understanding these limitations and contradictions, organizations can effectively implement XAI and ensure that AI models are transparent, accountable, and trustworthy.

## Recommendations

* Organizations should consider the limitations and contradictions of XAI when implementing AI models.
* XAI methods should be chosen based on the specific use case and industry.
* Further research is needed to address the challenges and limitations of XAI.
