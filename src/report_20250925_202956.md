# H-1B Visa Program Report
## Overview

The H-1B visa program is a non-immigrant visa program that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations that require specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or higher.

## Key Findings

* The H-1B program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been exploited to replace American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].
* The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both economic and national security [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].
* Some employers have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].
* The number of foreign STEM workers in the United States has more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, increasing from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million, while overall STEM employment has only increased 44.5 percent during that time [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].
* The H-1B cap for fiscal year 2026 has been reached, with 65,000 H-1B visa regular cap and 20,000 H-1B visa U.S. advanced degree exemption [https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season].

## Contradictions

Upon reviewing the findings, some contradictions were identified:

* The H-1B program's intent is to bring temporary workers to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but some employers have used the program to replace American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.
* The program has been criticized for undermining economic and national security, yet it is also acknowledged that foreign workers fill a critical need in the U.S. labor market, particularly in STEM fields.

## Proposed Changes

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed significant changes to how H-1B visa registrations are selected in the annual cap lottery, including a weighted selection system that favors higher-wage positions [https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/09/dhs-proposes-new-h1b-rule-that-prioritizes-higher-paid-workers].

## Conclusion

The H-1B visa program is a complex and multifaceted issue, with various stakeholders having different perspectives on its benefits and drawbacks. While the program has been criticized for its potential to undermine American workers and national security, it also provides a critical pathway for foreign workers to contribute to the U.S. economy, particularly in STEM fields.
