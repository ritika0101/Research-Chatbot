# H-1B Visa Program: Recent Developments and Changes
The H-1B visa program has undergone significant changes and proposals in recent times. This report aims to summarize the key findings and contradictions.

## Presidential Proclamation and Fee Implementation
On September 19, 2025, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation restricting the entry of certain nonimmigrant workers, including H-1B visa holders [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/]. 

As of September 21, 2025, a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa petitions has been implemented, greatly impacting employers' ability to secure highly educated foreign workers [https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/trump-100000-fee-h1b-visa/].

## Program Changes and Proposals
The H-1B program allows companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations requiring highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or higher [https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season].

Recently, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposed significant changes to the H-1B visa lottery system, prioritizing higher-wage positions [https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/09/dhs-proposes-new-h1b-rule-that-prioritizes-higher-paid-workers].

## Statistics and Trends
Between 2000 and 2019, the number of foreign STEM workers in the United States more than doubled, from 1.2 million to almost 2.5 million [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].

In computer and math occupations, the foreign share of the workforce grew from 17.7% in 2000 to 26.1% in 2019 [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/].

## Contradictions
Contradictions were found in the data, particularly in the numerical values and dates mentioned across different sources. For instance, the effective date of the $100,000 fee was mentioned as September 21, 2025, in some sources [https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/trump-100000-fee-h1b-visa/], while others mentioned September 19, 2025 [https://www.jw.com/news/insights-h1b-visa-program-proclamation/].

## Conclusion
The H-1B visa program is undergoing significant changes, including a new fee structure and proposed changes to the lottery system. These developments aim to prioritize higher-wage positions and highly educated foreign workers. However, contradictions in data and implementation dates may cause confusion among stakeholders.
