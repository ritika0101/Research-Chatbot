# H-1B Visa Program Report
## Overview

The H-1B visa program is a non-immigrant visa program that allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in occupations that require highly specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or higher [https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations/h-1b-cap-season).

## Key Findings

* The H-1B visa program has been criticized for being exploited to replace American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/).
* The program has led to a significant increase in foreign STEM workers, with numbers growing from 1.2 million in 2000 to almost 2.5 million in 2019 [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/).

For instance, the number 1 is reported with different URLs: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/), [https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/h-1b-faq](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/h-1b-faq), and [https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/h1b-visa-program-fact-sheet/](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/fact-sheet/h1b-visa-program-fact-sheet/). 

## Proposed Changes

The Department of Homeland Security has proposed significant changes to how H-1B visa registrations are selected in the annual cap lottery, including a weighted selection system that favors higher-wage positions [https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/09/dhs-proposes-new-h1b-rule-that-prioritizes-higher-paid-workers](https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/09/dhs-proposes-new-h1b-rule-that-prioritizes-higher-paid-workers).

## Conclusion

The H-1B visa program is a complex and contentious issue, with various stakeholders having different opinions on its benefits and drawbacks. While the program aims to bring in highly skilled foreign workers to fill labor gaps, it has been criticized for being exploited to replace American workers. The proposed changes to the program aim to address some of these concerns, but it remains to be seen how they will impact the program's effectiveness and fairness.
