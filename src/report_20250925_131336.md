**H-1B Visa Overview:** The H-1B visa allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa].  These occupations require theoretical and practical application of specialized knowledge and a bachelor's degree or higher [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa].  The initial stay is typically three years, with a maximum six-year physical presence allowed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa].  The program is administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa].  H-1B status can exist without a physical visa stamp [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa].

## Contradictions

A direct contradiction is not evident in the provided data.  However, the differing levels of detail and focus across sources prevent a fully integrated picture.  For example, the Indian Express article focuses on the proposed changes under the Trump administration, while the Wikipedia article provides a broader overview of the H-1B visa program's history and regulations.  The Microsoft blog post is unrelated to the H-1B visa.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile potential inconsistencies in the numerical data across sources.
